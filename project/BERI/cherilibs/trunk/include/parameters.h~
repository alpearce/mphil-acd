 * CHERI bus configuration parameters for PISM.
 *
 * WARNING:  Historically, this file was automatically generated by
 * tools/cheri_genfiles.py, extracting parameters from the Altera project
 * configuration.  THIS IS NO LONGER TRUE.
 *
 * The following are physical addresses as configured on CHERI's bus, and are
 * intended for short-term use in PISM while we complete work on dynamic
 * configuration.  If they are used in software intended to run *on* CHERI,
 * then they should be translated to virtual addresses using the macros below.
 * 
 *
 * In the future, we will want to have most of these passed from hardware to
 * software using FDT, and avoid hard-coding them.
